## Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and improvements. To submit a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
2. Make your changes and ensure that the code is well-documented and follows the project's coding style.
3. Write tests for your changes and ensure that all tests pass.
4. Commit your changes and push your branch to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request on GitHub with a clear description of your changes and the problem they solve.

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain a consistent codebase, please follow these coding guidelines:

- Write clear and concise docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable functions.
- Organize imports logically, separating standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports.
- Add type hints to function signatures to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Ensure that the code follows a consistent formatting style, such as PEP 8 for Python. Use tools like `black` or `flake8` to enforce consistent formatting.

## Testing

We encourage you to write tests for your changes to ensure that the code is working as expected and to catch any potential issues early. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```
