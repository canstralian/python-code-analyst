## Project Description

The AI News Summarizer is a Python web application built with Streamlit and Cloudflare Workers AI. It allows users to input a news link and receive a summarized version of the article in a selected tone.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/cf-ai-lora-news-summarizer.git
   cd cf-ai-lora-news-summarizer
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
     ```
     CF_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id
     CF_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token
     ```

## Usage Examples

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Enter a news link and select the desired tone for the summary.

4. Click the "Enter" button to receive the summarized article.

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys. These variables are loaded from a `.env` file using the `python-dotenv` library. Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the required environment variables.
